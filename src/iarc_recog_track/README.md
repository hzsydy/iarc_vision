## Robust scale-adaptive mean-shift for tracking

Authors : Tomas Vojir, Jana Noskova, Jiri Matas

________________

This C++ code implements a tracking pipeline of Scale Adaptive Mean-Shift method.

It is free for research use. If you find it useful or use it in your research, please cite the [1] paper.

The code depends on OpenCV 2.4+ library and is build via cmake toolchain.

_________________
Quick start guide

for linux: open terminal in the directory with the code

$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. ; make

This code compiles into two binaries **demo** and **asms_vot**

./asms_demo  
- run live demo with visual output
- control : object is selected by mouse, click and drag mouse to select rectandle
  - ESC = quit
  - i = init new object

./asms_vot 
- using VOT 2015 methodology (http://www.votchallenge.net/), is backward compatible with older ones
 - INPUT : expecting two files, images.txt (list of sequence images with absolute path) and 
                   region.txt with initial bounding box in the first frame in format "top_left_x, top_left_y, width, height"
 - OUTPUT : output.txt containing the bounding boxes in the same format as region.txt

./asms_trax
- using VOT2014+ trax protocol
- require [trax](https://github.com/votchallenge/trax) library to be compiled
  with opencv support and installed. See trax instruction for compiling and
  installing.
